Project Structure
The hands on project on Machine learning with Docker is divided into following tasks:

Task-1: Getting started with Docker and how it helps Machine Learning 
Task-2: Building a custom Docker Image & Running a Docker Container
Task-3: Train machine learning models during the Docker image build process
Task-4: Serialize your models & Perform batch inference using Docker containers
Task-5: Understand Online Inference with a Real World Example
Task-6: Use Docker and flask-RESTful to perform online inference
